# Advent_of_Code_2024
Currently taking a break from 2023 to go through all previous calendars to further work on skills. Will be back :)

12/25/2023 - - Day 19 Part 1 and Day 21 Part 1

Reflections - Quickly became busy with holidays and work but was able to get a couple more done!

Day 19 became a task of learning; Spent a lot of time studying RegEx and was able to successfully implement it into working code.

Also did some practicing with assigning multiple variables when creating loops Day 21 felt similar to day 7? Gave it a try. I believe my conceptual tackling of the problem was fine; i.e. From each step taken, log all possible steps, run loop again from all new possible steps. This clearly wasn't the most efficient way as far as processing (millions of possibilities being ran) but worked! Was able to practice utilizing "set()" function Difficulties Could not figure out part 2 for either

12/18/2023 - - Day 10 Part 1 - Total time 2 hours

Reflections - Felt tedious but overall, very happy with the turn out

Difficulties

I had gotten the code correct early on, however, my counter for the final answer was not nested correctly. Don't really have an idea of how to tackle Part 2.

12/16/2023 - - Day 9 - Total time 1.5 hours

Reflections - This came along pretty great! Part 2 felt easy as well

Difficulties

Took some time to try and consolidate. Tried to avoid either redundant or unnecessary variables. Took a little while to find my "while" ender. Originally thought I would count "0s" but realized that was unnecessary

12/15/2023 - - Day 8 - Total Time: 5 hours

Reflections - Once again I wasted hours because I hurried through the prompt.

Difficulties

READ THE DAMN PROMPT CORRECTLY Practiced setting up and calling functions Feel like code is readable and concise-ish Need to study how to properly format lines in a efficient way All in all difficulty 3/10

12/14/2023 - - Day 7 - Total Time: 4.5 hours

Reflections - The concept came early and I stuck to the plan. Wasn't the most optimized plan, but it worked!

Difficulties Learned some skills with creating and calling functions Learned some tricks with sort and lambda and keys Pt 2 definitely could have been optimized more; I was kind of on a roll spelling each step out and just continued with that process. Had a few hiccups as I overlooked a couple conditions. Getting a little faster at debugging.

12/13/2023 - - Day 6

Reflections - Took a break from Day 5 and it went smooth

Successes

Either this day was incredibly easy or I am actually learning something! (a little of both) I think background on math and physics beneficial

12/12/2023 - - Day 5

Reflections - This is going to be a Day 3 all over

Difficulties

I will come back to this after studying maps more. I was able to get it working with a very unoptimized, logically simple code for the test input. However, the code required creating/comparing lists with 10s of millions of data points, and my compute could not take it. Reviewed a couple cheat sheets which make me want to go a different, simpler route.

12/11/2023 - - Day 4

Reflections - Took a break from Day 3 and dont regret it

Successes

Pretty straight forward Was able to get part 1 and part 2 without any aid! Part 1 can definitely be cleaned up. I think part 2 is tidy but things can always be made simpler

12/7/2023 - 12/Forever/23 - - Day 3 Part 1

Reflections - NEED TO RETURN TO

Difficulties

Thought I created a good system for getting previous, current, and next lines. Think that was a keeper Need a better solution for contextualized the number(I had been looking digit by but that runs into the issue of knowing when a digit is apart of a larger digit and storing the value of the larger digit)

(perhaps first I should identify all digits that belong to one number, then store the indexes of the digits in a list, then for the symbol search, look based off symbol index range of [min(digit list)-1:max(digit list)+1]

Within that loop, the digits can be stored in a terminating list... then if that digit has symbol, that terminating list can append the wanted value list

12/6/2023 - - Day 2 Part 2 Complete - Total Time: 2 hours

Reflections - May be the cleanest planning and execution yet!

Successes

Instead of constantly calling back three different arrays, I used a dict. to only call back a specific array as needed! Successfully used split() which made life so much easier. Continued practicing append() and learned clear() and min/max(). GOT IT ON FIRST TRY! I continue to misread the prompt though, need to be slower with instructions

12/5/2023 - - Day 2 Part 1 Complete - Total Time: 6 hours

Reflections - I think I did well on the plan, ran into a few hiccups with the structure

Difficulties

Have since learn split(), would have helped in getting numbers and ID Ran into big problems with "break"; was messing with identifying 3 digit values Learned some range(len()) situations

12/5/2023 - - Day 1 Part 2 Complete - Total Time: 10 hours - pt2.py

Reflections - This was a real pain.

Difficulties

Refamiliarized with dictionaries, range, len(), and creating functions Did not take the most efficient route of reading chunks out of each line of array

Creating a stop to nested For loop

Had to create a function "num_there" to fix false positive flaw in structure

Aware that I did not need as many lists/variables as I used

Inefficient structure; But glad I was able to stick with original plan and find a way

12/3/2023 - - Day 1 Part 1 Complete - Total Time: 4 hours - main.py

Reflections - Have some basic knowledge; Used A LOT of resources

Difficulties

Had difficulty getting the the "sum" counter correct.

.read().splitlines() v.s. .readlines()

reversed() vs "[::-1]"

learned isdigit() function

First attempts at using Python to solve challenges presented in the Advent of Code 2023 Calendar.
Attempting AoC with hopefully some new skills.
