**12/4/2025** -  - Day 3pt1 ~ 10 minutes ; 3pt2 ~ 3 hours

> > Read the prompt and immediately wanted to go the RegEx route. Part 1 went super smoothly with some refreshers.


> > *Difficulties*
> > > Still wanted to stick with RegEx for Part 2; I think I spent too much time trying to force it and use different re functions.
> > > Restarted the theorization; Once I decided to break the string up using split() and find(), life got much easier.


**12/2/2025** -  - Day 2 ~ 3 hours
> *Reflections*
> > Opening files and manipulating raw input came a lot quicker.
> > Were multiple avenues that I theorized, ended up starting and running with an idea, regardless of how optimized it was.
> > Would explore use of functions for the Asc/Desc and Diff comparisons; Would be able to call them again in Pt2.

> > *Difficulties*
> > > Had to remember to break a loop as to not create duplicates.
> > > Misremembered key function of pop() at specific index. Would have saved 2 hours.

**12/1/2025** -  - Day 1 ~ 1.75 hours
> *Reflections*
> > It took longer than I expected for my thought logic to reconnect with my logic logic.
> > I knew how I wanted to tackle the problem immediately, but confused myself with read() vs. readlines() vs. split() and manipulating the initial raw input.
> > Happy that the for loops came pretty quickly

> > *Difficulties*
> > > Should refamiliarize with read(), readlines(), split(), list*


Attempting AoC24 with hopefully some new skills.
